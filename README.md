- 👋 Hi, my name is Farid Zouheir.
- :office: I currently work as a software developer for a Special Health Authority within the NHS Wales.
- 👀 During my free time I enjoy building applications and small games in Java. (At the moment I'm working on a side open-source project called [JRobots](https://github.com/zhrfrd/JRobots)).
- 🌱 I like the idea of writing good code not just for the machine but also for the person who is reading it and, for this reason, I'm currently learning different refactorization methods usign the book "Refactoring" by Kent Beck and Martin Fowler as a guide.
